brand value of 10 most fast food franchise, customer satisfaction index rate, worldwide
pizza locations. The rest of the data and facts are collected from other online websites

# Outline
Designing and creating an infographic needs more creativeness and patience. They
are many online tools available for creating charts and designing infographics.

diagram depicts the number of stores; money spends on an advertisement, total
revenue, the category of the menu, brand values of ten fast food firm, the customer
satisfaction index, worldwide locations and pizza delivery mode and social media

websites data.

➢ Designed an A3 Size (297*420 mm) background image related to pizza with
use of Adobe Photoshop.

# Justification
Let start to see from the top of the Infographics chart
The number of stores showed with the shop images of different sizes for the year
2010,2012,2014,2016. Notably, as over the years the number of store increases. The
shop PNG image will convey the data information more interestingly while looking at
the data.


The money spent on the advertisement is designed by placing a line chart on the
television image. The line chart was created in excel sheet and used a yellow colour
to create some contrast to the tv colour. The idea to use tv image was to highlight the
advertisement spending in the tv screen.

The revenue image illustrates the bar graph, by indicating a dollar symbol. The visual
data tells about the revenue of Domino's pizza from 2010-2017, and the money values
are measured regarding US dollars.

United States of America map portrays the origin of Domino’s pizza in the year 1960.

A menu card holding by a chef was represented to show the different type of cuisine.
To make the things more graphically interesting placed the data in the book which was
holding by a chef.

The fact representing 1.5 million pizzas sold per day was made with the talk symbol
by pinpointing the pizza image using photoshop.

The treemap represents the value of the most ten international fast food brands.
Notably, Mc. Donald’s stands first by 52% followed by star bucks 18%. Each colour
represents the company logo colour, in addition placed the company logo to highlight
the treemap.

The customer satisfaction index image, represented with the meter was used to depict
the values of customer scores from 2010-2017. As the picture shows different shades
of colour, notably 82 seen in green colour indicates a good score followed by 78 where
the metering pin sits in the red colour. The visual conveys green tone a positive side,
and the red colour is a dangerous side.

The map shows the number of international locations in the world. Radium green is
used to make the countries to highlight.

The delivery man and store says about for customer who order online either can get
home delivery or store pick up.

The social media icon at the bottom of the page mentioned will help customers to get
touch with them through social media accounts.
